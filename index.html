Hello! My name is Audrey Wu, and I have a wonderful dog that I am dedicating this website to. She's my best friend and never ceases to make me laugh with her goofy habits and facial expressions. I've begged my parents since 1st grade for a pet dog; and after reading countless dog books, writing a 10-page paper on how to take care of a dog and the annual costs, as well as constant pursuading, they finally caved when I gave them an ultimatum: either a baby brother or a pet dog. It just so happened my mom's friend had a new litter of puppies born on Christmas Eve, and so 2 days after my birthday in 6th grade, on February 11th 2004, I brought home my new 7-week old puppy. That was the best day of my life.
